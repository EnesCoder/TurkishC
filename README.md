# TurkishC
TurkishC is C but turkish, chose a random language I have heard.

This project is mostly to show a C Transpiler I made in C++, which relies on tokenization and a translation dictionary.

The dictionary is written in JSON, and the fun thing is you can edit it however you want to your needs! There is a spanish example in the project for example.
Add translations, delete translations, change translations.
And then add a third argument while using the transpiler, which is your dictionary's path.

in the build directory:
* ./transpileTc (path to your file to get transpiled) (the output .c file) (your dictionary path, OPTINAL)

This is just a side project, so I think you will just look at the code, which I would not recommend. So nothing important.
