# TurkishC
TurkishC is C but turkish, chose a random language I have heard.

This project is mostly to show a C Transpiler I made in C++, which relies on tokenization and a translation dictionary.

The dictionary is written in JSON, and the fun thing is you can edit it however you want to your needs! There is a spanish example in the project for example.
Add translations, delete translations, change translations.
And then add a third argument while using the transpiler, which is your dictionary's path.

* ./transpile (path to your file to get transpiled) (the output .c file) (your dictionary path, OPTINAL) *

This is a thing just which just got started so it has bugs for sure, and not many words in the dictionary. I don't think I will mess with this project again but if I do I will update stuff for good.

Have fun sir
